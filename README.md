# Welcome to GitHub

I have seen Git or GitHub before. <br />
I can use basic functions like branching, committing changes, and merging with other repositories. <br />
I can use more advanced functions designed for collaborating with others and managing changes to source code. <br />
I use Git and GitHub regularly in my day to day work. <br />

l have seen this language before.

I am learning the basics like variables, conditionals, arithmetic, basic syntax, and string manipulation.

I can read other peoples code. I can find and fix simple bugs.

I can break down problems and prepared to reuse existing code, while implementing new functions/classes of my own and specialized libraries. I can trace the execution of most programs with ease.

I can manufacture lean, well structured code to solve complex problems utilizing the full extent of the language's feature set.

# Rule of Probability

Have you previously seen probability notation?
Have you ever seen the basic rule of probability?
For the reference, we review those here.

Probabilities are defined for events. An event is some outcome that
we could potentially observe or experience, such as
the result of rolling a fair six-sided die.

(English grammar note: die is singular, dice is plural.)

In mathematical notation, we often write an event as a capital letter,

for example, ${A}$ is the event that we roll a ${4}$
on a fair six-sided die. This event has probability ${1/6}$,
so we would write ${P}({A}) = {1}/{6}$.

We might want to represent the numerical result of the die roll
as the random variable ${X}$, and then we could also write
${P}({X=4}) = {1}/{6}$.

In the careful dice observation, probabilty must be:
{0}, Between, and {2}.

The Red Dice Theorem must result between {0} and {2}.
