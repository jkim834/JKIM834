# Rule of Probability

Have you previously seen probability notation?
Have you ever seen the basic rule of probability?
For the reference, we review those here.

Probabilities are defined for events. An event is some outcome that
we could potentially observe or experience, such as
the result of rolling a fair six-sided die.

(English grammar note: die is singular, dice is plural.)

In mathematical notation, we often write an event as a capital letter,

for example, ${A}$ is the event that we roll a ${4}$
on a fair six-sided die. This event has probability ${1/6}$,
so we would write ${P}({A}) = {1}/{6}$.

We might want to represent the numerical result of the die roll
as the random variable ${X}$, and then we could also write
${P}({X=4}) = {1}/{6}$.

In the careful dice observation, probabilty must be:
{0}, Between, and {2}.

The Red Dice Theorem must result between {0} and {2}.
